# Decision 010 — Paper plan, deferred until project matures

**Status:** deferred (intent captured; writing blocked)
**Date:** 2026-05-16

## What this is

A capture-the-intent memo, not a draft. The eventual artefact for this project is a methodology paper. We choose to defer writing it until the empirical scaffolding strengthens.

## Why defer

The paper's strongest claim is "this evaluation framework identifies a candidate book that holds up on data the authors never touched." That claim requires:

1. **Forward held-out window** (Binance 2026-06 → 2026-12, locked by decision 005 pre-decision Q3). Currently untouched and must remain so until this sprint completes.
2. **30-day paper-trade dry-run** for the candidate book {T3, R∧T2} on Hyperliquid (per decision 004 / 005 next-sprint).
3. **Decision 009** — portfolio-aware K1. The R∧T2 "K1 breach is portfolio-justified" framing is currently informal; it needs to be codified before review.
4. **Two-leg PairsZScore v2** — pre-decision Q4 was overridden to single-leg in the 2026-05-16 sprint. Either the v2 implementation rescues X1 (changes results) or confirms the killed verdict (strengthens it). Either way the result changes the paper.
5. **Extend Binance funding parquets to full 5.5y** — currently 2.3y of 5.5y, which truncates C1 and F1 evaluation. Re-running these on full history may move them between categories.

Writing now means writing twice. Each of the five items above rewrites at least one section of the paper. Better to write once, after the project is mature.

## Target

- **Format**: ACM `acmart` `sigconf` style, two-column.
- **Length**: 6-8 pages excluding references.
- **Venue (when ready)**:
  - First-line: **ICAIF** (ACM AI in Finance) — workshop or main track.
  - Second-line: NeurIPS Workshop on AI in Finance.
  - Fallback: **arXiv preprint** (no venue lock-in; cite-able immediately).
- **Bibliography**: assembled from `wiki/papers/` (≥10 papers already curated).

## Structure (when written)

1. Abstract (150w)
2. Introduction — practitioner gap (Sharpe/Calmar alone is the norm); contribution (layered evaluation + multi-scheme MDB + cross-cycle validation + pre-registration as multi-testing defense)
3. Related work — DSR (López de Prado 2014), regime detection HMM, funding-rate carry literature, slippage-at-risk, backtest-vs-live divergence
4. Data and substrate — Binance perp, 5.5y common window, 5-coin universe, fees, Freqtrade
5. Methodology — layered evaluation stack with formal definitions, MDB-eq/rp/mv with equations, pre-registration framework
6. Strategy taxonomy — six families (T / R / C / R∧T / R∧C / X / F)
7. Experimental setup — common window, walk-forward refits, pre-flight gates
8. Results — common-window leaderboard, correlation matrix, MDB ablation, candidate book, **forward held-out (after sprint)**
9. Discussion — portfolio-aware K1, negative results' value, pre-registration as multi-testing defense
10. Limitations
11. Future work
12. References

## Figures (already available)

- `wiki/assets/correlation_matrix.png` — strategy correlation heatmap (will need serif re-render for publication)
- `wiki/assets/pareto.png` — 3-panel Pareto chart (Calmar/MDD, Martin/Ulcer, MDB/corr)
- **To create**: MDB scheme ablation chart (showing where MDB-eq, MDB-rp, MDB-mv disagree)
- **To create**: Layer-5 catches Calmar lie — a worked example showing FundingCarry or R2 by Calmar vs by Ulcer/Pain

## Tables (already available)

- Common-window leaderboard (`_index.md`)
- MDB results across schemes (`_correlation_table.json`)
- Pre-registered kill criteria summary (across decisions 004 / 006 / 007 / 008)

## Pre-conditions for writing

In order:

1. [ ] Decision 009 (portfolio-aware K1) is written and applied.
2. [ ] Two-leg PairsZScore v2 ships and X1 is re-evaluated.
3. [ ] Binance funding parquets extended to 5.5y; C1 and F1 re-run on full window.
4. [ ] 30-day Hyperliquid paper-trade dry-run for {T3, R∧T2} completes; result documented.
5. [ ] Forward held-out window (Binance 2026-06 → 2026-12) downloaded and run once; result documented verbatim (no parameter tweaks).

After step 5, write the paper in 1-2 focused sessions and post to arXiv. Hold conference submission for a second editorial pass.

## What is NOT pre-conditioned

- The article series (`backtesting/wiki/course/` parallel to `feishu/wiki/course/`). This serves a different audience (blog / casual) and can be written independently when motivation strikes. Not on the critical path.
