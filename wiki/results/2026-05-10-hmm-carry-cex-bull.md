# HmmCarry — CEX bull-window validation — 2026-05-10

**Strategy file:** `user_data/strategies/HmmCarry.py` (unchanged; reads Binance funding via `CARRY_FUNDING_EXCHANGE=binance`)
**Data:** Binance USDT-margined perp, 4h, 6 pairs (BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, AVAX, ARB), 2022-11-01 → 2025-01-01 (warm-up 2 mo + 24 mo evaluation)
**Funding source:** Same Binance parquets as the FundingCarry bull run
**Config:** `user_data/config_binance_multi.json`, `max_open_trades=6`, `--fee 0.00035`

## Thesis

Per `wiki/results/2026-05-10-hmm-carry-conjunction.md`: the bear-window conjunction (`bull_prob ≥ 0.65` AND `funding_roll < −0.00001`) returned −19.59% with anti-complementary entry timing — HMM reactive (lags), funding forward-looking (leads). Hypothesis: in a bull regime both signals point the same direction, so the conjunction should *tighten* correctly instead of selecting late-cycle bull lag × early-cycle bear lead.

## What worked

- **Hypothesis confirmed: conjunction is regime-conditional.** Bull-window flips from −19.59% to +25.77% on an unchanged strategy. The "anti-complementary" verdict from the bear-window card was specific to the regime, not structural.
- **Calmar 13.68 is the strongest of the three bull-window runs** (vs FundingCarry 3.06 and HmmRegime4Rolling-multi 27.73 over equity-curve daily basis — though absolute return is lower than HMM-multi). The conjunction's effect is to *filter for high-conviction trades*, halving trade count vs HMM-only while raising win rate from 35.2% to 46.2%.
- **Rolling-window HMM refit (no look-ahead) is honest.** Same machinery as `HmmRegime4Rolling`; 1000-bar fit window every 168 bars.
- **MDD 4.54%** — much tighter than FundingCarry's 10.65% on the same universe / same period. The filter is doing real work.

## What didn't

- **DOGE and ARB are near-zero or negative.** Sparse entries (2 and 8 trades) — small-sample noise dominates, but the strategy is clearly not equally effective across all coins. Per-coin signal viability needs separate validation.
- **BTC almost flat** (+0.06% on 21 trades, 42.9% win). Funding-rate-negative + HMM-bull is a less informative combination on BTC than on alts, mirroring the bear-window finding (BTC was 7.7% WR there).
- **Most return concentrated in 2 of 6 pairs.** SOL+AVAX = +26.91% of the +25.77% total. The conjunction is alt-driven; BTC/ETH/DOGE/ARB contribute marginally.

## Next test

1. **DSR gate.** 158 trades + 6 pairs is sufficient N. Run before any leaderboard promotion.
2. **Time-priority variant.** Require `funding_roll < threshold` to have been negative for K bars *before* `bull_prob` crosses 0.65 (lead-then-confirm). This separates true reversal setups from coincident-alignment, which was the bear-window failure mode.
3. **Alt-only run.** Drop BTC/ETH and rerun on SOL/AVAX/DOGE/ARB. If the alt-only conjunction stays > +20% with Calmar > 10, the strategy is structurally an alt-funding-conjunction strategy, not a generic regime tool.

## Implication for `learnings.md`

Entry #5 ("Signal conjunction without sign assignment is suspect when signals have different time horizons") needs amendment: **the time-priority issue is bear-specific**. In bull regimes the HMM lag and funding lead align constructively. Update the entry to "regime-asymmetric" rather than "fails."
