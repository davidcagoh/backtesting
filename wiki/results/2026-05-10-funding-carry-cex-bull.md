## Thesis

Per `wiki/results/2026-05-10-funding-carry.md` follow-up: the bear-window result (−30.16%, 10.6% win rate on 7 Hyperliquid majors) was hypothesised to be regime-specific, not a fundamental failure of the funding-rate-carry signal. This run tests the inverse — does the same unmodified strategy work in a sustained bull?

## What worked

- **Hypothesis confirmed.** The naive funding-carry signal flips from disaster to viable when the regime is bull. 5 of 6 pairs positive; win rate 52.4% vs 10.6% in bear. Average loser remains the −10% stop (29 stops hit) — the loss mechanism is identical, but winners now compound.
- **BTC is the best pair** in bull, was a loser in bear. Funding-rate dynamics on BTC track the regime more reliably than on alts.
- **MDD scales with vol, not with the signal.** SOL and AVAX have ~5% MDDs (high-vol alts); BTC and ETH stay under 1%. Position sizing by vol would smooth this.

## What didn't

- **ARB is the only bull-window loser** (−1.01%, 28 trades). Listed in 2023-03 and may have anomalous early-listing funding dynamics; not enough data to disentangle.
- **MDD 10.65% is large relative to bull-only returns.** The drawdown sits in 2023-08 → 2023-10 (the summer 2023 chop window between the early-year rally and Q4 ETF-anticipation rally). The strategy correctly stops out of bad entries but the cluster of stops adds up.
- **Calmar 3.06 is well below SmaRegime180 bull windows** (Calmar 14–21 in 2020-21 and 2023-24 on BTC). The signal is real but the risk-adjusted return is moderate.

## Next test

1. **Add a regime filter.** Slope-up gate (e.g. price > SMA180 like `SmaRegime180`) as a precondition for the carry signal. Expectation: bear-window MDD drops sharply, bull-window return drops modestly. If true, the gated version is a leaderboard candidate.
2. **Inverse-sign test.** Long when funding > positive threshold (longs paying funding = healthy bull confirmation). Tests whether the regime-conditionality is about *direction of funding* or about *price regime*.
3. **DSR gate.** 252 trades is enough N for a Deflated Sharpe Ratio test. Run before promoting any gated variant.

## Implication for `learnings.md`

Entry #4 ("Funding-rate carry … fails catastrophically in bear regimes") needs a 2026-05-10 amendment: **the signal is regime-conditional, not broken**. Bull-window result here flips return from −30.16% to +12.47% and win rate from 10.6% to 52.4% on an unmodified strategy. Promote to "open hypothesis: regime-gated funding-carry as leaderboard candidate."
