## Thesis

The 2026-05-10 multi-asset bull-window run showed `HmmRegime4Rolling-multi` is bull-amplifying (+65.36%, Calmar 27.73) but bear-blind (−5.62% / MDD 14.7%). `SmaRegime180`'s slope-gate is the opposite shape — flat through bears, modest in bulls. Hypothesis: gating HMM entries by `sma180_slope > 0` should suppress HMM's bear false-positives while preserving most of the bull capture.

If this works, the two-segment Pareto frontier (Sma left, HMM-multi right) collapses to a single dominant point.

## What worked

- **Bear MDD cut by 41%** (14.7% → 8.65%). The slope gate is doing exactly what it was designed to do.
- **Profit Factor improved** (1.60 → 1.77) despite halved trade count. The gate filters trades that are *worse than average*, raising the quality of the survivors. This is the structural argument for using regime filters at all.
- **Worst-pair loss tiny in bull window** (ETH −0.37%). Five of six pairs positive; only ETH-bull-trade selection underperforms, and barely.
- **Bear-trade count crashes from hundreds to 50.** The strategy genuinely stops trading in bears, which is what the kill-criteria framework was designed for.
- **AVAX best-trade +123.69% survives** — same massive winner as unfiltered HMM-multi. The gate doesn't filter out the high-conviction setups, just the marginal ones.

## What didn't

- **No frontier collapse.** Sma is still on the frontier (lower bull return, lower bear MDD); HMM-multi is still on the frontier (higher bull return, higher bear MDD). HmmSmaSlope sits *between* them as a third frontier point. Not a single-strategy dominator.
- **Still in kill-zone for bear MDD.** Decision 004 sets the SmaRegime180 kill rule at MDD > 5.5%; HmmSmaSlope's bear MDD 8.65% breaches that line. It's a better bull-side strategy than HMM-multi, but it's *not paper-trade-ready* under the existing kill criteria.
- **Bull return drops 15pp.** The cost of the gate is real — for a pure bull bet, unfiltered HMM-multi is still the right answer.
- **Sharpe (CT) drops 38%.** Trade-economic improvement is offset by the smoother equity curve having less return per unit risk. The closed-trades Sharpe is misleading for filtered strategies — daily-wallet Sharpe (1.30 vs 1.25 for unfiltered HMM-multi) is the honest read.

## Next test

1. **Slope-gate parameter sweep.** SMA period 180 + slope lookback 6 is the SmaRegime180 default. A weaker slope filter (e.g. SMA90 or shorter lookback) would let more HMM entries through — possibly recovering bull return without giving back the bear MDD reduction. Pareto-search candidate.
2. **DSR gate on the three frontier strategies.** With Sma, HMM-multi, and HmmSmaSlope now all on the frontier, deflated Sharpe is the right tiebreaker for "is the signal noise-distinguishable?"
3. **Position-size scaling instead of binary gate.** Per `decisions/004-kill-criteria-sma-regime-180.md`'s continuous-shrinkage formula, the right move may be to *shrink* size as slope weakens rather than skip entry entirely. Tests whether the gate's binary cliff is leaving signal on the table.

## Implication for the Pareto frame

The frontier has three points now, not two:

| Point | Bull return | Bear MDD | Trades / yr (bull) | Role |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| **SmaRegime180** (BTC) | +20.0% | 1.74% | ~16 | Bear-resilient endpoint |
| **HmmSmaSlope** (6 coins) | +50.5% | 8.65% | ~130 | Middle frontier point |
| **HmmRegime4Rolling-multi** (6 coins) | +65.4% | 14.7% | ~239 | Bull-amplifying endpoint |

The chart now shows a kinked frontier rather than a single segment — Sma → HmmSmaSlope → HMM-multi. Picking a strategy is now a *three-way* tradeoff: capital preservation (Sma), capital growth with bear control (HmmSmaSlope), or pure bull capture (HMM-multi).

For paper-trade graduation under the current kill criteria (MDD > 5.5% = hard kill), only SmaRegime180 still qualifies. HmmSmaSlope is the strongest *candidate-with-modifications*: lower its bear MDD below 5.5% via a tighter slope gate or a continuous-shrinkage size rule, and it would dominate Sma on bull return while preserving the kill-rule compatibility.
