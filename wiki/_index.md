## Strategy Leaderboard

Primary sort: **Calmar** (CAGR / |MDD|). Sharpe is always shown as a sanity check. Higher is better on both. See `wiki/decisions/003-baseline-eval.md` for the evaluation baseline.

| Strategy | Calmar | Sharpe | CAGR | MDD | Trades | Data | Report |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|---|
| `LongOnlyStrategy` (placeholder) | -4.55 | -0.36 | -1.61% | 1.86% | 49 | BTC 1h, 2025-10-06 → 2026-04-24 | — |

Rows added here whenever a new strategy is backtested. Link the Report column to the relevant `wiki/results/<date>-<strategy>.md` file.

## Repository Layout

| Path | Role |
|------|------|
| `freqtrade/` | Fresh clone of the upstream Freqtrade repo (gitignored — it has its own `.git`). Ships a Hyperliquid adapter. |
| `user_data/config.json` | Minimal Hyperliquid config (dry_run, futures/isolated, USDC stake, Feather format). No keys committed — fill `walletAddress` / `privateKey` only for live trading, not needed for backtesting. |
| `user_data/strategies/LongOnlyStrategy.py` | SMA-cross placeholder strategy so the original `notes.md` command still runs. Replace with real logic. |
| `user_data/data/hyperliquid/` | Where `scripts/download_hyperliquid.py` writes Feather OHLCV files (futures land under `futures/`). |
| `scripts/download_hyperliquid.py` | Custom Hyperliquid OHLCV downloader. Required because freqtrade's built-in `download-data` is disabled for Hyperliquid. |
| `notes.md` | Original crib sheet (preserved). |

The old `freqtrade_hyperliquid_download-data` gitlink was removed — see `decisions/001`.

## Setup (first run on this machine)

```shell
cd freqtrade
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .        # or: pip install -r requirements.txt
# talib may need a system install first: brew install ta-lib
```

> The install step needs explicit approval in agent sessions — it executes freqtrade's setup code. Run it manually.

## Download data

**Use the custom script at `scripts/download_hyperliquid.py`** — freqtrade's built-in `download-data` is disabled for Hyperliquid (`ohlcv_has_history=False` in the adapter). The script hits `https://api.hyperliquid.xyz/info` directly and writes Feather files into freqtrade's expected layout. See `decisions/002` for why.

Run from the wrapper repo root (`backtesting/`):

```shell
./freqtrade/.venv/bin/python scripts/download_hyperliquid.py \
  --pairs BTC/USDC:USDC ETH/USDC:USDC \
  --timeframes 1h 4h
```

Cap: ~5000 candles per (pair, timeframe). That's ~208 days at 1h, ~833 days at 4h — Hyperliquid API ceiling, not a tooling limitation.

## Backtest

```shell
./freqtrade/.venv/bin/freqtrade backtesting \
  --userdir user_data \
  -c user_data/config.json \
  --data-format-ohlcv feather \
  -s LongOnlyStrategy -i 1h \
  -p BTC/USDC:USDC \
  --eps --max-open-trades 1
```

Flag notes:
- `--data-format-ohlcv feather` — data is stored as Feather.
- `--eps` — `--enable-position-stacking`, allows re-entry.
- `-p BTC/USDC:USDC` — futures pair notation (base/quote:settle).
